# Building the HTML site

This repo contains the OpenStax *University Physics* CNXML source (3 volumes,
322 modules) plus an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) build that renders it as
a browsable HTML site. **The content files (`collections/`, `modules/`,
`media/`) are never modified** — all transformation happens at build time, so
merges from the openstax upstream stay clean.

## Quick start

```bash
npm ci
npm run update:vendor    # copy the self-hosted MathJax (+fonts) and MiniSearch bundles into assets/
npm run build            # build _site/ + search index
npm run serve            # dev server at http://localhost:4000/university-physics-bundle/
```

Requires Node ≥ 22.

## How it works

- `_data/book.js` → `lib/book-data.js` parses `META-INF/books.xml` → the three
  CollXML collections → all 322 CNXML modules, in two passes:
  1. **Model pass** (`lib/parse/`, `lib/model/`): assigns chapter/section
     numbers and OpenStax-style slugs (`/university-physics-volume-1/1-3-unit-conversion/`),
     runs the chapter-scoped counters (Figure 1.5, Equation 2.10, Example 1.2,
     Check Your Understanding 1.3 — spanning all modules of a chapter), and
     builds a global anchor map for `<link>` resolution.
  2. **Render pass** (`lib/render/`): CNXML → HTML (paras with block-splitting,
     CALS tables, notes/examples/exercises in the markup contract the viewer
     JS expects, MathML passed through for client-side MathJax, glossaries,
     footnotes, learning-objective boxes from `md:abstract`).
- `pages.njk` paginates over the resulting 338 pages (the preface and 7
  appendices are shared by all three volumes, so 322 modules → 338 URLs).
- `summary.njk` emits `/SUMMARY.html`, which the client-side book viewer
  (`assets/js/book-viewer.js`, adapted from the `physics-book2` repo) fetches
  to build the collapsible 3-volume sidebar, prev/next navigation, and SPA
  page swapping.
- Math is presentation MathML rendered client-side by self-hosted **MathJax v4**
  (`mml-chtml`), configured in `assets/js/math-config.js`. The `mathjax-newcm`
  fonts are self-hosted too: `math-config.js` points MathJax's `[fonts]` loader
  path at `assets/js/mathjax/fonts/` (populated by `npm run update:mathjax`),
  so nothing is fetched from a CDN. The prefix-dependent URL is derived from
  the config script's own `src` at runtime.
- The site is an installable **PWA**: `manifest.njk` emits
  `/manifest.webmanifest` and `sw.njk` emits the service worker `/sw.js` (both
  as Nunjucks templates so URLs carry the deployment's path prefix, and the
  precache version tracks the build via `_data/build.js`). The worker
  precaches the app shell and uses network-first for HTML, cache-first for
  `media/`/`cover/`/MathJax fonts, and stale-while-revalidate for other
  assets; registration lives in `_includes/foot.njk`. Icons are in
  `assets/icons/` (PNGs rasterized from `icon.svg` via a headless-browser
  canvas).
- The 16 duplicated pages (preface + 7 appendices × the 2 extra volumes) get
  `<link rel="canonical">` pointing at the Volume 1 copy: `lib/book-data.js`
  sets `canonicalUrl` on every occurrence after a module's first, and
  `_includes/head.njk` emits it as an absolute URL under `site.baseUrl`
  (`_data/site.js`).
- `scripts/build-index.js` (postbuild) builds the MiniSearch index over
  `_site/` (search runs client-side on the self-hosted copy of MiniSearch in
  `assets/js/vendor/`, populated by `npm run update:minisearch`);
  `scripts/verify-build.js` (`npm run verify`) asserts page counts,
  link/fragment integrity, media existence, numbering sequences, canonical
  links on exactly the 16 duplicated pages, and zero CNXML leakage.

## Deployment

The path prefix is `/university-physics-bundle/` by default (GitHub Pages
project site). When the `VERCEL` env var is set, the site builds with no
prefix for root hosting. The built site is ~230 MB, dominated by `media/`.

GitHub Actions:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — pull requests: `npm ci` →
  `npm run update:vendor` → build → `npm run verify`.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — pushes to `main` (and manual dispatch):
  same build + verify, then deploys `_site/` to GitHub Pages.

## Known divergences from openstax.org

- End-of-chapter exercises restart numbering per review section instead of
  numbering continuously across the chapter (the aggregated numbering can't be
  reproduced while review sections stay embedded in their section modules).
- 15 images use remote `https://openstax.org/l/...` URLs and load from the
  network; 15 `<iframe>` interactives point at external simulations.

## Gotchas

- The dev server does **not** hot-reload changes to `lib/` (Node's ESM cache
  keeps transitive imports of `_data/book.js`); restart `npm run serve` after
  editing build code. Content edits under `modules/`/`collections/` rebuild
  fine.
- `assets/js/mathjax/` (MathJax + fonts) and `assets/js/vendor/` (MiniSearch)
  are git-ignored and populated by `npm run update:vendor`; a fresh clone
  must run it before building or math/search will 404.
- When testing the service worker against a static server without
  `Cache-Control` headers (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`), the browser's
  heuristic HTTP cache can serve stale JS that looks like a service-worker
  bug; test in a fresh browser profile/context. GitHub Pages sends
  `max-age=600`, so deployed clients settle within minutes.
